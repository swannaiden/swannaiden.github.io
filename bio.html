<p><strong>Hi !</strong> I’m a 2nd year PhD student at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a> University, co-advised by Prof. Monroe Kennedy and Prof. Mac Schwager. I’m a member of the <a href="https://arm.stanford.edu/">ARM Lab</a> and the <a href="https://msl.stanford.edu/">Multi-Robot Systems Lab</a>. I’m funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and the Stanford Graduate Fellowship.</p>

<p><strong>I want to endow robots with the sense of touch</strong>. Centered on theory, learning, and innovative hardware solutions, my research aims to enhance robotic dexterity. By leveraging tactile sensing, we can develop general policies for dexterous manipulation in robots.</p>
