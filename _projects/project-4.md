summary: Caltech ME14 Octagon design project. A two week design based robotics competition. No designs are constructed. 
color: olive

The Octagon project was a design only project conducted during the second half of ME14 at Caltech. Sophomore meches are presented with a theoretical game and must produce a strategy and design for a competitive robot over the course of two weeks. I worked with the same team as the transmission competition project. We produced a robot which drives through the scoring elements, allowing us to score at a greater speed. The rules of the octagon game are found below, along with our design and my engineering notebook for the class.
