## Introduction
As a member of the Caltech AIAA team we received a $140,000 grant for our cable based lunar transportation method. I worked on the autonomy and planning aspects of the project. Developing a robotic system with novel rover locomotion modalities for use in extreme lunar terrain applications. I developed a novel graph based path planning method for finding cable paths on a lunar topology map. 

Below are two renders which I generated that show our system operating in Shackleton crater.

Here is a brief document which summarizes most of my contributions during Spring term 2022. We are currently working on preparing for the submission of our final report and technical demonstration.
