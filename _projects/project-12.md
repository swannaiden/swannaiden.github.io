summary: Machined a model Wankel rotary engine as my project in Caltech's CNC machining class ME23. In this class I learned the essentials of CNC machining on Mills and Lathes. We used a Trak CNC mills and Lathes and well as Haas CNC machines. I did all aspects of programming and setup to make each of the parts.
