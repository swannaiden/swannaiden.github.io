Due to the remote conditions of the pandemic the Caltech chemistry lab course, ch3a, was forced to move online. The professor wanted to send every student a chemistry kit to do the experiments at home. Part of that kit was a webcam. My friend and I developed a web based application that could be used as a spectrometer with only a desktop webcam. Below is a document outlining the term worth of work my friend and I put into this project.
