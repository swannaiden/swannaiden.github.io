I conducted a summer undergraduate research fellowship (SURF) at Caltech for the summer of 2021. I worked in the AMBER lab at Caltech, working closely with Prof Aaron Ames and graduate student Drew Singletary. At the conclusion of the project we wrote a paper, *Onboard Safety Guarantees for Racing Drones:
High-speed Geofencing with Control Barrier Functions* which has been submitted to IEEE RA-L journal. 

Attached below is the video that we submitted with the paper

This paper was accepted by RA-L in January 2022. [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9691815?source=authoralert)
