**Hi!** I'm a 3rd year PhD student at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/) University, co-advised by Prof. Monroe Kennedy and Prof. Mac Schwager. I'm a member of the [ARM Lab](https://arm.stanford.edu/) and the [Multi-Robot Systems Lab](https://msl.stanford.edu/). I'm funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and the Stanford Graduate Fellowship.

**I want to build everyday home robots**. Centered on theory, learning, and innovative hardware solutions, my research aims to enhance robot performance on challenging tasks. Currently I am interested in leveraging tactile sensing to enable dexterous manipulation and making vision language action (VLA) models more generalizable.
