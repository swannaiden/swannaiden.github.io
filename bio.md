**Hi !** I'm a 2nd year PhD student at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/) University, co-advised by Prof. Monroe Kennedy and Prof. Mac Schwager. I'm a member of the [ARM Lab](https://arm.stanford.edu/) and the [Multi-Robot Systems Lab](https://msl.stanford.edu/). I'm funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and the Stanford Graduate Fellowship.

**I want to endow robots with the sense of touch**. Centered on theory, learning, and innovative hardware solutions, my research aims to enhance robotic dexterity. By leveraging tactile sensing, we can develop general policies for dexterous manipulation in robots.
