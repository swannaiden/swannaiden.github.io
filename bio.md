**Hi !** I'm a 2nd year PhD student at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/) University, coadivsed by Monroe Kennedy and Mac Schwager. I'm a member of the [Assistive Robotics and Manipulation Lab](https://arm.stanford.edu/) and the [Multi-Robot Systems Lab](https://msl.stanford.edu/). I'm funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and the Stanford Graduate Fellowship.

**I want to endow robots with a sense of touch** My research focusing on applying theory, learning and novel hardware to improve robot dexterity. Tactile sensing has the potential to unlock general dextrous manipulation policies for robots.
